NumberedList
===

PopClip extension to turn lines of text into Markdown numbered items. Will sort and update an existing numbered list as well, and convert bullets on list items to numbers.

This is only here if you want a separate button for numbered lists. Otherwise you can just use BulletList and hold down option to create an ordered list instead.
